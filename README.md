# Gender Inequality Analysis

## Introduction

Gender inequality in education is a critical barrier to achieving global development goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) and Goal 5 (Gender Equality). Despite significant progress, disparities persist, particularly in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Addressing these disparities is essential for fostering socio-economic development, improving health outcomes, and empowering women and girls.

## Problem Statement

Gender inequality in education remains pervasive in many parts of the world, leading to severe social, economic, and health consequences. Girls often face barriers such as traditional gender roles, early marriage, gender-based violence, poverty, and inadequate school infrastructure. These factors contribute to lower enrollment and completion rates for girls compared to boys. This project aims to analyze data on gender inequality in education to identify key trends, barriers, and successful interventions, and to propose data-driven solutions to bridge the gender gap in education.

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to analyze gender disparities in education and propose actionable solutions to reduce these disparities. The specific objectives are:
•	To collect and analyze gender-disaggregated education data from reliable sources.
•	To identify the primary barriers to girls' education in various regions.
•	To understand the temporal and spatial trends in gender disparities in education.
•	To assess the impact of gender inequality in education on socio-economic outcomes.
•	To propose actionable solutions and policy recommendations to promote gender equality in education.
•	To evaluate the potential impact of these solutions on achieving SDG 4 and SDG 5.

## Data Sources
The project will use education datasets from the following sources:
Kaggle: Various gender inequality datasets are available on Kaggle, such as the "Gender_Inequality_Index" and "Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap"

## Features of the Datasets
### 1. Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap Dataset
This dataset includes the following features:

•	JobTitle: The title of the job held by the individual.

•	Gender: The gender of the individual (e.g., Male, Female).

•	Age: The age of the individual.

•	PerfEval: Performance evaluation score of the individual.

•	Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual.

•	Dept: The department in which the individual works.

•	Seniority: The seniority level of the individual in the company.

•	BasePay: The base salary of the individual.

•	Bonus: The bonus received by the individual.

### 2. Gender Inequality Index Dataset

This dataset includes the following features:

•	Country: The name of the country.

•	Human_development: The human development category (e.g., Very high).

•	GII: Gender Inequality Index value.

•	Rank: The rank of the country based on the Gender Inequality Index.

•	Maternal_mortality: The maternal mortality ratio in the country.

•	Adolescent_birth_rate: The adolescent birth rate in the country.

•	Seats_parliament: The percentage of parliamentary seats held by women.

•	F_secondary_educ: The percentage of females with at least secondary education.

•	M_secondary_educ: The percentage of males with at least secondary education.

•	F_Labour_force: The percentage of females in the labor force.

•	M_Labour_force: The percentage of males in the labor force.


## Tools for Analysis
The following tools and technologies will be used for data analysis:
•	Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
•	Google Colab: For documenting the analysis process and visualizations.

## Questions for analysis.
•	Is human development gender specific?

•	What is the relationship between the labor force and the gender Inequality Index?

•	What is the relationship between the human development index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the distribution of parliamentary seats?

•	What is the difference in gender base pay by job title and education?

•	How does the performance of male and female employees compare?
